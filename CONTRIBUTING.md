# Contributing to site-builder

## Find an issue that you want to work on

https://github.com/donthedeveloper/site-builder/issues

First think about where you are actively trying to grow - *backend* or *frontend*.

If you are actively trying to grow on the front end, look for the following labels:
- react
- redux
- css (also basic css with static landing pages)

If you are actively trying to grow on the backend, look for the following labels:
- jest (building tests)
- express (routing)
- mongoose (db)

What can be helpful to get better context of what features those issues are a part of is to look at issues that contain the label "feature".

Once you find an issue that you would like to start working on, or even if just have questions, join us on [Slack](http://slack.donthedeveloper.tv) and let us know. Be sure to join the channel `site-builder` when you get there.

## Fork the repository (make a copy)

This will allow you to make a copy of the project that you now control. You can now make any changes to that project without affecting the original.

## Clone the fork (download the copy)

Make sure you have git installed. You'll want to clone your forked copy of the repository to get it downloaded to your local machine.

## Create a git branch on your local computer

Just a reminder, when you clone your project, you will actually create a new folder that contains the project contents. The folder is most likely called `site-builder`. Move into that directory with `cd site-builder`. In the project directory, you can type `git branch` to see what branch you are currently on. If you've just downloaded the project, you should be on `master`. If you have been assigned an issue to work on, just be sure that your branch name starts with the issue number. For example, if the title of your issue is `Login Form` with the issue number as `24`. You could create the branch as `24-login-form`. The only thing that matters in the branch name is that you start the branch name with the issue number. This will conveniently, allow the issue to be pushed through the tracking process. You can see more about how issues are laid out on [Waffle.io](https://waffle.io/donthedeveloper/site-builder/join).

## Get the project up and running

You can find instructions on how to get the project up and running successfully here in our [README](README.md)

## Start coding and commit the work

Make commits as you make progress. Remember, commit early and often. Once you feel like you are finished, you'll push your local branch up to your forked version. You will then need to create a PR against our repository in order to merge the code in.

Here's the [article](https://medium.com/@jenweber/your-first-open-source-contribution-a-step-by-step-technical-guide-d3aca55cc5a6) that this contributing file was based on. It will provide all of the details you need on how to do these things. Of course, if you still have questions, please don't hesitate to ask.
